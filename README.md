# GOOSE Plotter

GOOSE, the **G**raphical **O**scillation **O**bservation **S**oftware
**E**nvironment: an interactive Tk window for plotting columns from delimited text data files
(`.txt`, `.text`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.dat`). The preamble, header line and
delimiter are detected automatically.

## Install

### Linux and macOS

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
2. Get the code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Quarrinexus/GOOSE-Plotter.git
   cd GOOSE-Plotter
   ```
3. Run it. The first run downloads Python 3.13 and the dependencies into
   `.venv`; later runs start straight away.
   ```bash
   uv run goose-plotter
   ```

### Windows

In PowerShell:

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
   then close and reopen PowerShell so the `uv` command is found:
   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```
2. Get the code, either with [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win):
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Quarrinexus/GOOSE-Plotter.git
   cd GOOSE-Plotter
   ```
   or by downloading the ZIP from GitHub (Code > Download ZIP), extracting
   it, and running `cd` into the extracted folder.
3. Run it. As on Linux, the first run downloads Python 3.13 (Tk included)
   and the dependencies; later runs start straight away.
   ```powershell
   uv run goose-plotter
   ```

Settings are kept in `C:\Users\<you>\.config\goose-plotter\settings.json`.

### A command that works from any folder

On any system, instead of `uv run` from the project folder:

```bash
uv tool install .
```

The command runs the code as it was when installed. After changing or
updating the code, install it again from the project folder:

`uv tool uninstall goose-plotter` removes it. If the `goose-plotter` command
isn't found afterwards, run `uv tool update-shell` and open a new terminal.

## Update

From the project folder, get the latest code:

```bash
git pull
```

If you downloaded the ZIP instead, download it again and extract it over the
old folder (or somewhere new).

With `uv run goose-plotter` there's nothing more to do: the next run picks up
the new code, and any new dependencies, by itself. If you installed the
command with `uv tool install .`, reinstall it from the project folder:

```bash
uv tool install --reinstall .
```

Your settings (`~/.config/goose-plotter/settings.json`) and each data folder's
`goose-plotter.json` profile live outside the project folder, so updating
keeps them.

## Use

At the top of the controls column, **Files** opens to the folders, Data
format and sessions (it starts closed once both folders are chosen). Under
it Dataset, the Lines list and the axes are always shown, and the rest is in
five tabs: **Splicing** (cutting lines to parts of their x), **Process**
(Smoothing, Background), **Derive** (FFT, Derivative), **Linking** (Linked
data) and **Measure** (reading numbers off the plot); their sections start open. If
the selected line can't be drawn (a bad function, a
file that won't load, a smoothing window that's too big), the reason shows
in red under the Y axis until it's fixed or another line is selected.
Other messages show above the buttons at the bottom of the column: green
ones (Saved ..., Undone) clear after 10 seconds, red ones stay until the
next message, and instructions for a pick under way (Click the panel ...)
stay until it's done or cancelled.

- **Data / Output folder** (under Files): choose with Browse...; both are
  remembered in `~/.config/goose-plotter/settings.json` (see Windows above).
- **Data format...** (under Files): set the delimiter, column-name line and
  first data line by hand, with a preview. Opens by itself when a file's layout
  can't be detected. Saved for the whole data folder in its profile.
- **Dataset, X axis, Y axis**: any column against any other, sample columns
  (`M006_AH`, `M011_AH_Loss`, ...) included. Changing a control redraws.
- **Function**: under each axis, e.g. `1/x`, `exp(y)`, `log10(x)`; numpy's usual
  functions plus `pi` and `e`. Enter applies.
- **Smoothing**: per line, under the axes. Moving average, median or
  Savitzky–Golay (with its polynomial order) over a window of points, taken in
  the order they were recorded; SG needs an odd window. Or set the window in
  **x units**: the plotted x, so with a `1/x` function on the field the window
  is in 1/B. Each point then uses the unbroken run of rows around it whose x is
  within half the window of its own, so separate sweeps aren't mixed, and SG
  becomes a polynomial fit in x, right for unevenly spaced points. It applies
  to the plotted y, after its function. To see raw and smoothed together, copy the
  line with + and smooth the copy; the legend tells them apart.
- **Background**: per line, under Smoothing. Fits a polynomial of the chosen
  degree (5 to start with) to the plotted y against the plotted x (so in 1/B with a `1/x`
  function) and either **Subtract**s it, leaving the oscillations, or
  **Show fit**, which draws the fit dashed in place of the data; copy a line
  with + to lay its fit over it. It fits the whole line as cut: to fit only
  part of it (leaving out the parked ends of a sweep), keep that part in
  the Splicing tab. The fit comes before smoothing.

  Tick **Advanced Fitting** to fit a function of your own instead of the
  polynomial. Greyed out, the **y =** box shows the polynomial the Degree
  fits (`A*x**5 + B*x**4 + ... + F`), and ticking starts you from it. Type
  a function of x there, with capital letters for the unknowns, e.g.
  `A * sin(B * x) + C` or `A + B / x`.
  Write `*` for every product (`A sin(x)` is refused); `^` or `**` is a
  power, and the Function boxes' functions (`exp`, `log`, `sin`, ...) and
  `pi` work. Every unknown starts at 1 unless **Start** gives it a value,
  e.g. `B=314, C=0`; a frequency or decay rate needs one close to the
  answer, or the fit settles on the wrong one. The values found show
  under the boxes. Untick it to go back to the polynomial; the function is
  kept for when it's ticked again. For a high-degree polynomial leave it
  unticked: typed out as powers of x, degree 15 or more can't be fitted as
  precisely as Degree fits it.
- **Splicing**: per line, in its own tab. Give a line any number of x
  ranges: type x ... to ... and **Add**, or **Pick** one by dragging across
  the plot. One setting covers all of them: **Keep ranges** cuts the line
  to what's in any of them (e.g. the parts of a sweep with the
  oscillations), **Remove ranges** cuts them all out (glitches, parked
  stretches), leaving gaps. Adding a range while it's Off turns on Keep
  ranges. Click a range in the list to see it in the boxes, where Enter
  changes it; **Delete** removes it. They're in the
  plotted x, after its function, and a blank end means no limit. The cut
  comes first, so it's what's drawn and all the background fit, smoothing,
  FFT and derivative ever see: an FFT of one kept range has its
  resolution, 1 / (the range's width). With Keep ranges on only those are
  drawn, so to pick outside them, turn it Off first. To only zoom in,
  without cutting anything, type a range in the axes editor instead.

  On an **FFT panel**, Splicing cuts the spectrum instead, in F: Pick a
  stretch of frequency and the plot fits itself to it, an easier zoom than
  the toolbar's; Remove ranges hides, e.g., the low-frequency end. It's the
  FFT panel's own, so its data panel and lines aren't cut (cut the data on
  the data panel). Changing x or its function clears it.
- **Line editor**: the box under + and -, which shows the selected line's
  look, opens it. **Colour** (drag in the field and the brightness strip;
  **Automatic** goes back to the sample's colour or a free one), **Line**
  (Auto is solid, or dashed for a shown fit; None leaves only the markers),
  **Width** (**Auto** undoes a set width), **Marker** with its **Size**
  (for any marker but None; **Auto** is 3), and **Name in the
  legend**, also shown in the Lines list: the box shows the automatic name
  until you change it; clear it to leave the line out of the legend, and
  **Auto** goes back to the automatic name (mathtext works; Enter applies). Everything else applies as you click, keeps the zoom, and
  follows whichever line is selected.
- **Axes editor**: the small plot button right of ⇅ opens it, for the selected
  panel (it follows the selection). Type an x or y range (**from** /
  **to**, Enter applies) in the plotted units, so in 1/B with a `1/x`
  function; leave an end blank to let it follow the data. **Use current
  view** fills the boxes from what the panel shows, e.g. after zooming, to
  pin it. A range is cleared when what's on its axis changes (another column
  or function), and ⇅ swaps the x and y ranges. **Title**, **x label** and
  **y label** show the panel's automatic text until you change it, which
  then replaces it (matplotlib mathtext like `$B$ (T)` works); clear a box
  to leave that text off, and **Auto** goes back to the automatic one. Left
  automatic, a text follows the data; one you've typed (or cleared) stays
  when the data changes, so update it with it. **Legend**: Auto shows one for two or more lines, Off hides it,
  and a position (a corner, or Outside right of the panel) shows it there
  even for one line. **Grid**: **show** Off, Major (the default) or Major +
  minor (fainter lines between the major ones), on **axis** Both, x only or
  y only, in **style** Solid, Dashed or Dotted. Legend and Grid apply as you
  click. **Ticks**: **Point inward** turns every panel's tick marks to point
  into the plot instead of out (off to start with); it's a preference for
  all panels, kept in `settings.json` until you untick it.
- **FFT** (Derive tab): **New panel** adds a row with the selected panel's spectrum
  under it; **Existing panel...** puts it in the panel you click next
  (asking first if that panel has lines of its own). The new panel is linked
  to the data panel (see Linked data below, and the Linking tab) with every
  Sync box ticked on both, so changing a line's axes, fit, smoothing or
  colour in either redraws both, and adding or removing a line does too; untick
  a box on it to keep that setting its own (e.g. untick Smoothing to take the
  FFT of the unsmoothed data), or **Freeze** it. The spectrum is of each line as plotted (after its function,
  background and smoothing) against its plotted x, so with `1/x` on the field
  it's in F (T); amplitude is in y's units. Select the FFT panel for its
  settings: Window (Hann or none), Padding (zero-padding, for smoother
  peaks), F max, and **Back to data**, which turns it back into an ordinary
  panel plotting its lines (still linked). Its title gives the frequency resolution,
  ΔF = 1 / (x range).

  **This panel** turns the selected panel into its own FFT instead, with no
  new panel. The button then reads **Undo**, which turns it back into the
  data, with the ranges and titles it had. While it's an FFT, the
  Derivative section's **This panel** swaps it for a derivative, and Undo
  still goes back to the data.
- **Derivative** (Derive tab): works like FFT. Choose the **Order**
  (First or Second), then **This panel**, **New panel** or **Existing panel...** (clicking
  an FFT panel of the same data turns it into the derivative). The panel shows dy/dx or d²y/dx² of each line as plotted,
  against its plotted x, linked to its data panel the same way. As the rows
  jitter and double back in x, each line is first averaged onto an even grid
  in x, and each point's derivative is read off a Savitzky–Golay fit over
  **Window** grid points around it (odd; 51 to start). Select the derivative
  panel to change its order or window, or go **Back to data**. Derivatives magnify
  noise, the second much more than the first, so widen the window until
  the curve is steady; a jump in the data shows as a spike.
- **Links** (Linking tab): **Link...** then click another panel, and the
  two are linked: they share their lines' settings, line by line (the
  selected panel, and any panels linked to it, take the other's number of
  lines, asking first if some would go). Each link is its own thing: a panel
  linked to panels 1 and 3 has a tab for each link, **Panel 1** and **Panel
  3**, which scroll sideways if there are too many, and the chosen link's
  panel gets a heavier dashed frame. The chosen link's **Sync** boxes say
  what it shares: **Dataset**, **X axis**, **X function**, **Y axis**, **Y
  function**, **Colour** and **Line style** (line, width, marker and its
  size) are ticked to start with; **Smoothing**, **Background** and
  **Splicing** aren't.
  The link is the same seen from either panel: panel 1's **Panel 2** tab
  shows the ticks of panel 2's **Panel 1** tab. So e.g. one panel shows the
  raw data, a linked one the same data with the background subtracted, and
  another that smoothed; or untick Y axis to plot another column against
  the same x. Ticking a box sends the selected panel's setting across.
  Settings go on along chains of links, each link passing on what it
  shares: with 1 linked to 2 (sharing the axes) and 2 to its FFT in 3, a new
  Y axis in 1 reaches 2 and then the FFT, while 2's background stays its own
  and still reaches the FFT. A frozen link stops them. Adding or removing a line, though, happens in every
  panel joined through links, so lines stay paired. Cut ranges and x-unit
  windows only cross between panels with the same x. FFT and derivative
  panels are linked to their data panel, with every box ticked. Axis ranges
  and zoom stay each panel's own. **Unlink** removes the chosen link, and
  **Freeze** pauses it, sharing nothing either way until **Unfreeze**, which
  sends the selected panel's settings across, carrying over what changed
  while it was frozen; the panel's other links carry on.
- **Measure** (Measure tab): reads numbers off the selected line as it's
  drawn (after its functions, cut, background and smoothing, and as an FFT or
  derivative on those panels), in the plotted units, and changes nothing.
  - **Region**: an x range typed, or dragged with **Pick**, shaded on the
    plot; blank is the whole line, **Clear** goes back to it.
  - **Readout**: the line's **Max** and **Min** (x and y), **Peak to peak**,
    **Mean** and number of **Points** in the region. On an FFT panel the max is
    refined with a parabola through its top three points, finer than one bin.
    **Mark the max and min on the plot** shows where they are.
  - **Points**: **Read points**, then click near the line: each click snaps
    to the nearest drawn point, keeping the last two, with dx, dy and 1/dx
    between them (on 1/B, 1/dx between neighbouring peaks is the frequency
    F, to check against the FFT). Esc stops.
  - **Peaks** (FFT panels): up to so many peaks in the region, highest first,
    above a percentage of the highest, each refined like the max; **Mark
    the peaks on the plot** labels them.
  - **Marks in saved figures** keeps the marks in what Save figure writes
    (they're left out otherwise); **Copy** puts the readout on the clipboard
    as tab-separated text, and **Export CSV** writes it to a file.

  The region, points and settings are the panel's own, saved in sessions
  and undoable. They're in the plotted units, so changing x or its function
  clears the region and points, and changing y clears the points.
- The controls column scrolls (mouse wheel or its scrollbar) when it's taller
  than the window.
- **Lines**: + copies the selected line, - removes it. Each line has its own
  dataset, axes and functions; click a line in the list or on the plot to edit
  it.
- **Plots**: the tabs above the plot, left of the toolbar, each hold a plot
  of their own (layout, panels, lines, links, the name to save under and
  its undo step); **+** makes a new, empty one, and **×** closes one (asking
  first if anything's plotted in it, as it can't be brought back). The
  data folder and the controls' tab are shared. Save session and Open
  session work on the plot shown. Switching resets the zoom.
- **Language**: the flag beside Layout shows the window's language; click it
  for English or 简体中文 (Simplified Chinese). The window opens again in
  the language chosen, carrying on where it was (panels, selection, tab and
  the undo step), and the choice is kept in `settings.json`. Only the
  window's own text changes: what's drawn on the plot (titles, labels,
  legends, Measure's marks, and so the names in the Lines list), file
  names, exported measurements and the reasons a line can't be drawn stay
  English, as do the plot toolbar, the Yes/No buttons on questions and the
  inside of the file chooser (Tk's own).
- **Layout**: hover to size the grid, click to apply. Click a panel to select it.
- **Delete panel** (beside Layout, at the bottom of the column): deletes the selected panel. The
  panels after it, across then down, move back one place, and the grid loses
  the row or column that leaves empty (a 3 x 1 stack becomes 2 x 1); in a
  grid of both rows and columns the last cell gets an empty panel instead.
  An FFT or derivative panel of the deleted one keeps its lines, unlinked. Ctrl+Z brings
  it back. There's always at least one panel.
- **⇅** (beside the X and Y axis boxes): swaps x and y, functions included, for
  every line in the panel.
- **Save figure**: writes to the output folder, named after the plot (e.g.
  `run_005_M006_AH_vs_1-over-Norminal_FIeld.png`) unless you type a name in
  Save as. No extension means `.png`; `.pdf`, `.svg` etc. also work. If a
  file of that name is already there, it asks before replacing it. Ticking
  **Don't ask me again** there stops the question; to bring it back, delete
  the `"overwrite_without_asking"` line from `settings.json`.
- **Saving Options** (beside Save figure): how Save figure writes the file. **Size**
  is **As on screen** (the default) or **Custom**, a **Width** and
  **Height** in inches or cm, e.g. a journal's column width; text keeps its
  point size, so a small figure has relatively larger labels. **DPI** (200
  to start) sets the resolution of PNGs and the like, with the size in
  pixels shown beside it (PDF and SVG stay sharp at any DPI). **Transparent**
  leaves out the white background. They're kept in `settings.json`, for
  every figure until changed.
- **Open session... / Save session...** (under Files): a session
  is a `.json` file holding the layout and every panel and line, with its
  settings, FFT and derivative panels, links, ranges, labels and styles, plus the data
  folder and a typed Save as name. Opening one switches to its data folder if
  that's still there. The data itself isn't in it, only which files to read.

### Keyboard

| Key | Does |
|---|---|
| Ctrl+S | Save figure (Enter in Save as does too) |
| Ctrl+Z | undo the last change (one step, for now) |
| Ctrl+D | copy the selected line (+) |
| Delete | remove the selected line (-) |
| Up / Down | select the previous / next line |
| Ctrl+arrow keys | select the panel beside the selected one |
| Esc | stop picking a range or a panel |

Delete and the arrow keys are left alone while you type in a box; click
the plot to get out of it.

## Profiles

A `goose-plotter.json` in the data folder tells the plotter about that folder's
columns. Everything in it is optional; without one, columns show under their
raw names. See [examples/goose-plotter.json](examples/goose-plotter.json).

```json
{
  "labels":   {"Norminal_FIeld": "$B$  (T)", "AH": "capacitance (bridge units)"},
  "units":    {"Norminal_FIeld": "T", "AH": "bridge units"},
  "samples":  {"M006": "#2a78d6", "M011": "#eb6834"},
  "defaults": {"x": "Norminal_FIeld", "y": "M006_AH"}
}
```

- **labels**: axis label per column (matplotlib mathtext like `$B$` works).
- **units**: shown beside the column in the X and Y lists.
- A key in labels or units also matches sample columns: `AH` covers `M006_AH`
  and `M011_AH`, labelled "M006 capacitance ...".
- **samples**: colour for each sample's lines; a column belongs to a sample if
  it starts with its name and `_`.
- **defaults**: the axes a new line starts on.
- **format**: written by Data format...; lines count from 1, `header_line` 0
  means no column names, `delimiter` is `tab`, `comma`, `semicolon`,
  `whitespace` or the character itself. Leave it out to detect automatically.
