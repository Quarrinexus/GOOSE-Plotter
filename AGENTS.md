# Notes for agents working on GOOSE Plotter

GOOSE (Graphical Oscillation Observation Software Environment), formerly
CMP Plotter: a Tk + matplotlib window for plotting columns of
capacitance-bridge (CMP) data files against each other. README.md describes it from the user's side;
this file is what isn't obvious from the code.

## Running

```bash
uv run goose-plotter
```

Python 3.13, managed by uv; dependencies are in `pyproject.toml`.

## Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

`tests/` runs on made-up data (`conftest.write_run`: a file laid out like
the real runs, B from 28 T to 4 T with an oscillation of 50 T in 1/B), so it
needs none of the author's. The calculation modules are tested directly;
`test_plotter.py` builds the real window with the `app` fixture, which
points it at a temporary data folder and settings file (never the user's)
and answers `askyesno`. Where Tk has no display those tests are skipped;
any other error making the window fails them. The window is hidden, and a
hidden window never lays out the plot's side, so a test clicking there
(the plot tabs) shows it first.
Add a test with each change, and still look at a saved figure or a
screenshot for anything visual; the width test only checks that every tab
leaves the controls column the same width.

No data ships with the repo. On the author's machine it sits inside a
Huairou-CMP folder whose `Analysis/data` holds real runs
(`Cambridge_Sep_26.00N.text`) with a `goose-plotter.json` profile; run
005 (a 28 T → 1 T sweep, 13k rows) and run 003 (24k rows, ~10k of them
parked at 28 T) are the useful ones, and `Analysis/squiggle-finder.py` is
the offline oscillation analysis the Smoothing, Background and FFT features
mirror. If that folder isn't around this repo, use whatever data folder
`~/.config/goose-plotter/settings.json` points at, or ask for some.

## Layout

| File | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `plotter.py` | the window: controls, drawing, zoom, saving |
| `model.py` | `Line` and `Panel`, colours, legend text, shared axis labels |
| `smoothing.py` | moving average, median, Savitzky–Golay; windows in points or x |
| `background.py` | polynomial fit in x, shown or subtracted |
| `splicing.py` | cutting a line to x ranges, or those ranges out of it |
| `spectrum.py` | FFT of a line against its plotted x, for FFT panels; `even_grid`, the binning it shares |
| `derivative.py` | first and second derivatives on `even_grid`, for derivative panels |
| `measure.py` | the Measure tab's reading: extremes in a region, peaks, parabola refining, snapping to a drawn point |
| `axis_functions.py` | the Function boxes (`1/x`, `exp(y)`, ...) |
| `datasets.py`, `format_dialog.py`, `profile.py`, `columns.py` | reading files and per-folder profiles |
| `widgets.py` | the line and axes editors, colour picker, layout grid, overwrite question, `TabStrip` |
| `session.py` | panels and lines to and from JSON-ready data, for session files and undo |
| `theme.py` | the window's colours and ttk styling; use its names, not hex codes, in Tk widgets |
| `i18n.py` | the window's language: `tr`, the menu helpers and the Chinese texts (`ZH`) |

## How a line is drawn

`Plotter._draw_panel`, per `Line`, via `_line_data`:

1. read the columns, apply the axis functions (`_axis`)
2. the cut (`splicing.cut`): `Line.cuts` is a tuple of (start, end)
   ranges, and `Line.cut` one mode for them all. Kept, the rows in none of
   them are dropped; removed, the rows in any turn to NaN in x and y, so it's drawn as a
   gap and fits and x-unit windows leave it out (SG in points still
   interpolates across it, as across any NaN)
3. background (`background.apply`): fit on the unsmoothed data, over the
   whole line as cut. Only the cut drops or blanks rows: the background had
   an x range of its own before session format 7, and `session._line` turns
   it into a Keep cut
4. smoothing (`smoothing.smooth`), on what's left
5. in a derived panel only, `spectrum.spectrum` or `derivative.derivative` of
   that against x
6. one `ax.plot` call

`_line_data` caches steps 1–4 per line, keyed on the line's settings, so a
data panel and its derived panels do the work once; `_reload_folder` clears it.

Keep that order. Things that depend on it:

- **One artist per `Line`.** The legend labels and `_show_colour` zip
  `ax.lines` against the panel's lines, and `self.artists` maps each artist to
  a line index. A second artist per line breaks all three; that's why "show
  the fit" is a mode on a copied line, not an overlay.
- **`Line.shown`** is the tuple of what was last drawn:
  `(run, x, x_fn, y, y_fn, smoothing, fitting, cutting)`. `parts()`, `legend_labels`,
  `_default_name` and the zoom logic in `apply_controls` all index into it, so
  a new per-line setting means updating each of them.
- **Style isn't in `shown`**, on purpose: `Line.style`, `width`, `marker`,
  `marker_size` and `label` go through `Line.plot_style()` and the legend only, so they
  don't touch the `_line_data` cache, the filename or the zoom logic. A
  width of None means `auto_width` (heavier for a shown fit), and a
  `marker_size` of None `AUTO_MARKER_SIZE`; `apply_controls` only stores the
  box's number if it differs from the auto one it showed.
- **Settings in x units** (`model.X_UNITS`: `Line.span`, `cuts`) are in the *plotted* x, after its function. They're
  cleared (`Line.clear_x_units`) whenever x or its function changes, or on
  ⇅, since a value in T means nothing in 1/B.
- Errors are stored in `Line.error` as `"<Stage> error: message"`.
  `_show_error` shows the selected line's under the axes boxes; it runs from
  `_load_controls`, which every redraw path ends in, so there's no popup.

## Derived panels are linked panels

`Panel.operation` makes a derived panel: "fft", "d1" or "d2" ("" is a data
panel; `Panel.derived`). It draws that of its own lines. `_derived` makes
one with copies of its data panel's lines, linked to it with every SYNC key
ticked, so it follows every change through the link (see below) and can be
frozen or partly synced like any link. `source` is only the cell it was
made from, for "FFT of panel N"; `_tidy_links` clears it once no link joins
them (unlinked, deleted, removed by the layout). So:

- Check `derived` / `operation`, never `source`, for whether a panel is
  derived. `operation` only matters where FFTs and derivatives differ
  (drawing, the Derive tab's boxes, `_default_name`).
- Derived panels are only made from data panels (no FFT of a derivative),
  and there's no cut-range picking on derivative panels. On an FFT panel the Splicing tab edits `Panel.cut` /
  `Panel.cuts` (`_cut_target`), a cut of the spectrum in F applied after F
  max, not its lines' cuts, which stay the data's (and follow the data
  panel through the link); `clear_ranges` clears it with x. Putting one on a panel already
  derived from the same data just changes its `operation`. **Back to data**
  (`back_to_data`) sets it to "".
- **This panel** (`in_place`) is the exception: it turns a data panel into
  its own FFT or derivative, with no link and no `source`. `Panel.data_view`
  keeps its `DATA_VIEW` values (typed ranges and texts) from before, for
  **Undo** (`undo_in_place`). Its being set is what marks such a panel, so
  it's saved in sessions (a tuple, via `session.TIDY`), and so it survives
  the global undo. Such a panel has Undo in place of Back to data; the other
  section's This panel changes its operation and keeps `data_view`.
- `_line_data` caches by `_data_key` (the settings through smoothing), not
  by line, so a data panel and its derived panels do the work once; a hit
  also fills in an x-unit span the line hasn't got yet. `_changed` prunes it
  to the lines still in the panels.
- `spectrum.even_grid` bins at bin centres for FFTs; derivatives pass
  `at_mean_x`, since the half-step error there becomes noise once
  differentiated. Keep the FFT's binning as it is unless you mean to change
  its output.

## Measure

The Measure tab reads each panel's selected line **as drawn** (the artist's
`get_xydata()`, so after F max and with a removed cut's NaN gaps), never
from `_line_data`. What it holds is the panel's (`Panel.region`, `points`,
`marks`, `marks_saved`, `peak_count`, `peak_floor`), not the line's, as a
derived panel's lines are copies in other x units. So:

- **Its marks are never lines.** `_draw_marks` uses `scatter`, `annotate` and
  `axvspan` (clipped to the data, so it can't widen x), kept per cell in
  `self.marks`; `ax.plot` or `axvline` would break the one artist per `Line`
  rule. `save` hides them unless the panel's `marks_saved`.
- What's read is kept in `self.measured` (not the Panel), so redraws make no
  undo steps; points are stored as clicked and snapped again each draw.
- `clear_ranges` clears the region with x and the points with either axis,
  which covers every path that clears typed ranges; ⇅ on a data panel
  clears them itself, as it swaps its ranges instead.
- `_show_measure`, from `_load_controls`, redraws every panel's marks, as
  selecting a line doesn't redraw but moves them. Measure edits redraw with
  `keep="xy"`, so they keep the zoom.
- **Read points** (`point_pick`) lasts until Esc or `stop_picking`; a click on
  another panel ends it and selects that panel.

## Links

A link joins two panels: `Plotter.links` maps the frozenset of their
`Panel.id`s (ids, not cells, as Delete panel and Layout move panels) to
a `Link`, whose `sync` names the `model.SYNC` keys it shares (read through
`Link.synced`) and `frozen` pauses it. Each panel has its own `Line`
objects, and axis ranges and zoom are each panel's own. So:

- Settings go along chains of links. After changing a line's settings,
  call `_sync_inputs(cell)`: breadth first from `cell`, each unfrozen link
  copies what it shares from the side nearer `cell` to the other
  (`_sync_across`: clearing its x-unit settings if its x changes, and never
  copying `X_UNITS` between different x), and each panel reached passes on
  in turn, once. So data → subtracted copy → its FFT stays in step though
  only 1-2 and 2-3 are linked. `apply_controls`, `swap`, the line editor
  and the colour picker call it. Keep `SYNC`'s "x" before the keys holding
  x-unit settings: that clearing runs after x is copied.
- Lines stay paired across whole chains: `_tied(cell)` is every panel
  joined to `cell` through links, one after another, and `add_line` /
  `remove_line` change every list in `_group_lists` (those panels'). `_link`
  gives `cell`'s side the target's number of lines when the two sides
  weren't joined yet. `_redraw_selected` and `_set_selected_line` use
  `_tied` too.
- The Linking tab shows one link at a time: `_chosen_link` is the selected
  panel's link with `link_partner` (an id), else its first. Freeze, Unlink
  and the Sync boxes act on it; ticking a box or unfreezing sends the
  selected panel's settings across it.
- `_tidy_links`, run by `_build_axes`, drops links to panels that are gone
  and clears a derived panel's `source` once no link joins them.
- Sessions before format 5 have no "cut" in their links' `sync`; `load`
  adds it to links that shared everything else (derived panels' included),
  so an FFT still follows its data panel's cut.
- `session.dump` / `load` carry the links (sorted, so undo compares equal
  states equal); sessions before format 4 had groups (`link_group`, and
  `sync` / `frozen` on each panel), which `load` turns into a link between
  every pair in a group, sharing what both ticked and frozen if either was.

## Typed axis ranges

`Panel.x_min` ... `y_max` (`model.RANGES`) are in the plotted units, like
the x-unit line settings, so they're cleared the same way: `_clear_ranges`
when a line's x or y changes, including a linked member's in
`_sync_inputs`; ⇅ swaps a data panel's (a derived panel's are cleared);
changing a derived panel's operation, or `back_to_data`, clears them.
The ranges a turned panel keeps for Undo (`Panel.data_view`) go the same
way: `_clear_ranges` clears them too, and ⇅ swaps them (`clear_data_ranges`,
`swap_data_view`). `_draw_panel`
applies them after drawing, which turns autoscaling off, so the zoom-keeping
in `_redraw_selected` treats them as user-set: after changing them, redraw
with `keep=""` (as `apply_axes` does) or the old range comes back.

The title, labels and legend names (`Panel.title`, `x_label`, `y_label`,
`Line.label`) are None for the automatic text and "" for none. `_draw_panel`
keeps what it drew in `auto_text` / `auto_names` for the editors to show;
Enter on a box still showing that text leaves it None. Sessions before
format 3 used "" for automatic, and `load` converts them. Typed texts are
checked with `text_problem` before they're stored: bad mathtext only fails when the
canvas draws, and on the real figure that would break every redraw after.

## Sessions

`session.dump` / `session.load` turn `self.panels` into plain data and back;
`Plotter._restore` swaps it and the links in. `dump` marks its output with `FORMAT`;
without it `load` reads the version 1 layout (`_load_old`), where a derived
panel had no lines of its own and every panel an "fft" operation. `load` drops unknown or mistyped fields and menu values that
aren't keys, and raises ValueError for anything that isn't a session, before
anything changes. A new `Line` or `Panel` field is saved automatically unless
it's in `session.SKIP`; one whose value must be a menu key goes in
`session.CHOICES` too, and one holding a list (JSON gives lists, undo
tuples) in `session.TIDY`, with what checks it. `Line.cuts` is one; a
format 5 line's single `cut_from` / `cut_to` becomes a one-range `cuts`.

## Undo

One step, built on the session snapshot: `_changed()` runs after every redraw
(`_build_axes`, `_redraw_selected`) and colour change, and when the panels'
`session.dump` differs from the last one, that last one becomes
`undo_state`. So a new action needs no undo code of its own as long as it
ends in one of those redraws. The colour picker calls it with `merge=True`,
making a drag one step. `undo` restores with `restoring` set, so the restore
isn't recorded as a change. Selection isn't in the snapshot, so selecting
isn't a step. Opening a session is undoable, but not its data-folder switch.

## Plots

The tabs above the plot (`plot_strip`) are separate plots. Only the one
shown is live, in the usual attributes (`panels`, `links`, `undo_state`,
...); each other one is kept in `self.plots` as `_plot_state()`, the session
dump plus the selection, Linking tab's link, typed name and undo step.
`switch_plot`, `new_plot` and `close_plot` keep the shown one and
`_load_plot` another, making no undo step. So anything a plot must keep
has to be in `_plot_state`; what's shared (data folder, profile, the
controls' tab, settings) stays out. A language change carries every plot
(`_relaunch_state` / `_resume`).

## Language

Every text Tk shows goes through `i18n.tr`, as a whole English sentence with
{named} places (never pieces joined, as Chinese word order differs), and
has an entry in `i18n.ZH`; `test_language.py` fails on any that hasn't,
from the source's `tr(...)` literals, the menus and a run through the
window. So:

- **Menus hold English, their boxes show `tr`.** A menu dict
  (`smoothing.METHODS`, `background.MODES`, `LEGENDS`, ...) stays English, as
  the legend text reads it too. Fill a Combobox with `menu(mapping)`, set it
  with `shown(mapping, key)` and read it back with `key_of(mapping, text)`,
  never by comparing to the English. Radio buttons keep keys as values.
- **Never translated:** stored values (Line and Panel fields, settings,
  sessions), anything matplotlib draws (no Chinese font is set up; titles,
  labels, legends, `_hint`, Measure's marks), file names and CSV exports,
  and `Line.error`'s details from the calculation modules.
- A template built with an f-string (`f"Pick the {what} range..."`) makes
  one key per value; each needs its entry.
- The language is set from the settings when a `Plotter` is made, before any
  widget. Changing it (`set_language`) saves it, keeps `_relaunch_state`
  and closes the window; `goose_plotter.main` opens a new one with it, and
  `_resume` carries on without making an undo step.
- Chinese needs full-width punctuation (，：（）“”) and only GB2312
  characters; no Δ, − or →. On Linux, Tk's X core fonts would take Chinese
  characters from Japanese and Korean fonts that lack many (drawn as
  boxes), so in Chinese `theme.use_font` sets every named font to song ti
  at 16 px (`i18n.FONTS`; one of its real bitmap sizes, so no other size),
  tabs included; Latin letters then fall back to a serif. The glyph test
  checks song ti draws every character.

## Things that look odd but are deliberate

- **Row order, not sorted x.** The field record jitters (hundreds of direction
  reversals per run) and parks at the ends of sweeps, so smoothing windows
  and x-unit windows follow the rows in the order they were taken.
  `smoothing.stretches` finds, per row, the unbroken run of rows within the
  window in x.
- **No scipy.** Savitzky–Golay is done in numpy (it matches
  `scipy.signal.savgol_filter` to rounding error); `background.fit` uses
  `numpy.polynomial.Chebyshev.fit` so high degrees stay well conditioned.
- **Drawn icons and triangles**, not Unicode arrows: Tk's X core fonts can
  show them as '®'. The same goes for text: in Tk widgets − (minus), – (en
  dash) and → show as '®' and Δ as '∈'. matplotlib draws them fine, so plot
  text keeps them and anything Tk shows goes through `plain()` in
  `plotter.py`, or is written in ASCII (the "Savitzky-Golay" method name).
  `·` and `×` are fine.
- **Zoom survives redraws** only for limits the user set (zooming turns
  matplotlib's autoscale off). `_redraw_selected(keep)` restores those and
  pushes the full view first so the toolbar's Home still works.
- **The tab strips are drawn** on a canvas (`widgets.TabStrip`), not made
  of buttons, for the notebook look: each tab as wide as its name, slanted
  sides, the chosen one in front and open onto what's below; the plots'
  have a × and a +. It's `width=1`, so it never widens its parent;
  `test_clicking_a_tab_shows_it` checks the controls' tabs still fit.
- **Tabs aren't a `ttk.Notebook`**: a Notebook is as tall as its tallest
  tab, which would keep the column long. `_show_tab` packs one frame of
  `self.tabs` and hides the others, so the column fits the tab shown.
- **matplotlib's toolbar is repacked** (`_toolbar_to_the_right`): at the top
  right of the plot, its buttons against the edge and the coordinates just
  before them (matplotlib packs the buttons at the left). It sorts the
  parts by type (labels are the coordinates and a filler), so a matplotlib
  that builds the toolbar differently may need it looked at.
- **The controls column is a scrolling canvas** (`self.side`) with the Save
  area pinned below it; the scrollbar shows only when the column is taller
  than the window, in a slot that keeps its width either way so the plot
  doesn't shift.

## Testing by script

For a look at something the tests don't cover, or on the real data:

Build the window, patch the popups so they can't block, drive the controls,
then read the state:

```python
from goose_plotter import plotter as P, smoothing
from goose_plotter.i18n import shown
P.messagebox.askyesno = lambda *a, **k: True  # the only popup questions left
app = P.Plotter()                      # uses ~/.config/goose-plotter/settings.json
app.run.set(next(n for n in app.datasets if "005" in n)); app.apply_controls()
app.smooth.set(shown(smoothing.METHODS, "savgol")); app.apply_controls()
print(app.panel.line.shown, app.error_label["text"])
app.fig.savefig("/some/scratch/dir/check.png")
app.destroy()
```

Set menus with `shown(mapping, key)`, not their English text: the settings
may choose Chinese, and then the English isn't one of the menu's texts.
`askyesno` comes up when making FFT or derivative panels or linking. Wrap runs in
`timeout`: an unpatched popup waits forever. Don't call
`choose_folder`, which rewrites the user's settings file.

## Style

- Match the surrounding code: short docstrings that say why, plain names,
  comments only where the reason isn't visible.
- UI text is plain and short; the left column is ~330 px wide, so check that
  a new control doesn't widen it (`app.side_inner.winfo_reqwidth()`).
- Update README.md's **Use** section when behaviour changes.
- Commits: an imperative subject line, then a body saying what changed and
  why, ending with the `Co-Authored-By` line the earlier commits use.
